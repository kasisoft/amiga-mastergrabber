  If you want to use MasterGrabber you have to read the installation
  chapter of one of the docs first. The included "bgui.library" is
  the optimized one for MC68020+ and AmigaOS 3.0+. I've added this
  version because nearly all persons who have registered are using
  a configuration that matches this library. To get the "bgui.library"
  for MC68000 download the bgui-user-distribution from the following
  site: "http://www.az.com/~ie/bgui" or use the one of the first
  MasterGrabber-Distribution.
